# Code Quiz

Code Quiz is a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. The application is responsive and runs in the browser, featuring dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code.

### Functionality

The landing page presents the user with the "Start Quiz" button and the navigation option to "View Highscores" and the "Time" value set at 0.

Clicking the "Start Quiz" button presents the user with questions and answer options in succession. The timer is initialized with a value of 75 seconds and immediately begins countdown.

Score is calculated by time remaining. Answering quickly and correctly results in a higher score. Answering incorrectly results in a time penalty - for example, 15 seconds are subtracted from time remaining.
